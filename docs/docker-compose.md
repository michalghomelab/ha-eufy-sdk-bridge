# Running the bridge with Docker Compose

The bridge is one container that logs into eufy **once** and exposes the SDK over a WebSocket (+ HTTP
video) for the [`ha-eufy-sdk`](https://github.com/mega-yfue/ha-eufy-sdk) Home Assistant integration.
The published image already bundles the exact pinned SDK revision, so you don't build anything — you pull and run.

- **Image:** `ghcr.io/michalghomelab/ha-eufy-sdk-bridge:latest` (`linux/amd64`)
- **Port:** `3000` WS/HTTP control (or `BRIDGE_PORT`)

> **One session per account.** eufy allows a single active login per account, so run **exactly one**
> bridge, and expect opening the phone app to bump the bridge's session (and vice-versa). The `data`
> volume persists the login so a restart doesn't re-authenticate.

---

## Option A — run it alongside Home Assistant (recommended)

Add this service to the same `docker-compose.yaml` you run Home Assistant from:

```yaml
services:
  # ... your existing homeassistant service ...

  eufy-bridge:
    image: ghcr.io/mega-yfue/ha-eufy-sdk-bridge:latest
    container_name: eufy-bridge
    restart: unless-stopped
    network_mode: host # needed for go2rtc WebRTC (UDP/ICE)
    environment:
      EUFY_EMAIL: "you@example.com"
      EUFY_PASSWORD: "your-password"
      EUFY_COUNTRY: "GB" # your account's country code
      BRIDGE_HOST: "0.0.0.0" # bind all interfaces
      BRIDGE_PORT: "3000" # change the WS/control port here if 3000 is taken
    volumes:
      - /opt/homeassistant/eufy-bridge-data:/app/data # persists the login token
```

Start just the bridge:

```bash
docker compose up -d eufy-bridge
docker compose logs -f eufy-bridge
```

Because HA and the bridge share the host network, point the integration at **`localhost`** (or the
server's LAN IP) and the port you set.

---

## Option B — standalone (bridge on its own host)

`docker-compose.yaml`:

```yaml
services:
  eufy-bridge:
    image: ghcr.io/mega-yfue/ha-eufy-sdk-bridge:latest
    container_name: eufy-bridge
    restart: unless-stopped
    network_mode: host
    env_file: .env
    environment:
      BRIDGE_HOST: "0.0.0.0"
    volumes:
      - ./data:/app/data
```

`.env` (next to the compose file):

```dotenv
EUFY_EMAIL=you@example.com
EUFY_PASSWORD=your-password
EUFY_COUNTRY=GB
BRIDGE_PORT=3000
```

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Point the integration at this host's IP and `BRIDGE_PORT`.

## First run: 2FA / captcha

On the first login eufy usually requires **2FA** (or a captcha). The bridge does **not** exit on this —
it stays up and reports the auth state over the WS, so you resolve it one of two ways:

- **From the Home Assistant integration (recommended).** Add the `ha-eufy-sdk` integration, enter the
  bridge host + port, and it walks you through the 2FA/captcha steps in the UI.
- **From the CLI** (from a checkout of this repo): `node scripts/login.mjs ws://HOST:PORT/ws` — it
  prompts for the code, or writes the captcha to `captcha.png` for you to solve.

Once authenticated, the token is saved in the `data` volume and restarts won't re-prompt.

---

## Verify it's up

```bash
curl -s http://HOST:PORT/healthz          # {"ok":true,"auth":{"state":"ok"},...}
node scripts/devices.mjs ws://HOST:PORT/ws # lists your devices (from a repo checkout)
```

See [`ws-protocol.md`](./ws-protocol.md) for the full WebSocket protocol.

## Notes

- **Architecture:** this fork publishes `linux/amd64` only. Its release workflow deliberately avoids
  QEMU after arm64 emulation proved unreliable; add arm64 back there only when it becomes a real target.
- **Not host networking?** WebRTC needs UDP/ICE, which is awkward behind bridge networking. If you drop
  `network_mode: host`, publish the ports (`3000`, `1984`, `8554`, `8555/udp`) and expect to sort out
  WebRTC separately; control + snapshots + RTSP still work.
