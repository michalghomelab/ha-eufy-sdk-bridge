The host-facing daemon: one process that logs into eufy **once** and exposes the
[`eufy-sdk`](https://github.com/michalghomelab/eufy-sdk) to a frontend — Home Assistant, a web UI,
anything. This fork is a small amd64 control bridge; Frigate consumes the camera's native RTSP.

```
WS    :3000/ws             control, state, events     ← the frontend talks to this
HTTP  :3000/stream/<sn>    live video (Annex-B)       ← go2rtc pulls this
HTTP  :3000/snapshot/<sn>  a JPEG still
HTTP  :3000/healthz        which cameras are streaming
```

Video is deliberately **not** on the WebSocket: the WS hands back a URL, and _connecting to that URL
is what starts the camera — disconnecting is what stops it_. There is no "stream is running" flag to
drift out of sync.

## Run it

Pull the published image and run it (the exact SDK revision is bundled):

```bash
docker run -d --name eufy-bridge --network host \
  -e EUFY_EMAIL='you@example.com' -e EUFY_PASSWORD='…' -e EUFY_COUNTRY='GB' \
  -v /opt/eufy-bridge-data:/app/data \
  ghcr.io/michalghomelab/ha-eufy-sdk-bridge:latest
```

or with Compose (`cp .env.example .env` first): `docker compose up -d`.

> Status: working — WS control + auth-over-WS (2FA/captcha), device listing, snapshots, and go2rtc
> streaming. Published image: `ghcr.io/michalghomelab/ha-eufy-sdk-bridge` (`linux/amd64`).
> **Publishing a GitHub Release** builds and pushes the versioned + `:latest` tags
> automatically ([`.github/workflows/publish-ghcr.yml`](./.github/workflows/publish-ghcr.yml)); the same
> build runs locally via [`scripts/publish-multiarch.sh`](./scripts/publish-multiarch.sh). A merge to the
> `dev` branch publishes a rolling `:dev` tag for testing.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome — please branch from **`dev`** and open your PR against **`dev`** (not
`main`). See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for the branch model, CI checks, and how releases
are cut.

## Develop

The bridge is ESM and depends on the SDK fork at the exact commit pinned in both package files. The
SDK's `prepare` hook builds its TypeScript sources during installation, so stale checked-in `dist`
output cannot leak into a release.

```bash
npm install
npm test          # node --test
npm run lint      # prettier --check .   (npm run format to fix)
```

Every PR into `main` or `dev` runs the CI gate ([`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](./.github/workflows/ci.yml)):
`npm ci` → lint → compile (`node --check` on each `.mjs`) → test. `main` is the public release line;
`dev` is the development line (rolling `:dev` image).
